# Web Directory Scanner with Download Capability

The `web_dir_scanner_with_download.py` script extends the basic functionality of the Web Directory Scanner by not only detecting accessible directories or files on a web server but also downloading content from paths that return a "200 OK" response. It automates the process of checking for the existence of paths listed in a wordlist and downloading the content for further analysis or review.

## Features

- Scans web servers for accessible directories/files using a custom wordlist.
- Downloads content from successful paths.
- Simple command-line interface for easy usage.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- requests library

Before running the script, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can install the required requests library using pip:


## Usage

To use the script, you need to provide two arguments: the base URL of the web server you wish to scan and the path to your wordlist file.


- `<host>`: The base URL of the web server (e.g., http://example.com).
- `<wordlist_path>`: The path to the wordlist file containing the directories or files to check.

## Preparing Your Wordlist

A wordlist is a simple text file that contains one directory or file path per line. These paths will be appended to the base URL provided to scan the web server. Hereâ€™s an example of what the contents of a wordlist file might look like:
Ensure your wordlist is tailored to the specific site or application you're scanning, and it's stored in a location accessible by the script.

## Running the Script

Navigate to the directory containing your script and run it using the following command, replacing `<host>` and `<wordlist_path>` with your values:
The script will iterate through each path in your wordlist, check for a "200 OK" response, and download the content if successful. Downloaded files are saved in a directory named downloads located in the same directory as the script, with filenames derived from their URLs.

## Wordlist Reference

For comprehensive wordlists used for directory and file discovery, consider checking out the following resource:

These wordlists can provide a robust starting point for your web directory scanning and content downloading tasks.
